# YsolekQuest

**YsolekQuest** The prototype of the game titled the adventures of professor ≈Åysolek made using the godot 2D/3D game engine.

For prototyping , i downloaded some assets from itch.io and opengameart.org under free licenses and some i created myself in blender and gimp.

Inspiration and sample very small fragments come from free examples available on the web, documentation, as well as the state machine I used from examples, perhaps gdquest.
